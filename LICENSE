ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

This addon is inspired by and builds upon the concept of the original MoneyTrail
addon by qweekWOW (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/moneytrail).

While this is a complete rewrite for modern WoW versions (The War Within and
Midnight), we acknowledge and thank qweekWOW for the original vision and design
that made gold tracking addons a beloved part of the WoW addon ecosystem.
